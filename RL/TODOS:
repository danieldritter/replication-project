1. Using the reward function, create labels for the value of each state (phase) in each game.
    a. Apply the reward function to all states in a game
    b. Run the discount function to get the values for each state (cumulative disc reward)
    c. Add that to the dictionary board_dict_list in process.py
        i. key: "value"
           value: {country: value(country) for all countries}

2. Write the critic:
    a. Input: a state (e.g. one phase, 81 * 35 vector)
    b. Output: (7,) vector representing the value for each power.

3. Pretrain the critic with each game; labels are the values computed in task 1.

4. Write a loss function for the actor/encoder using 15-step return.

5. Write the while loop that interfaces with the engine,
    combines actor/critic loss, optimizes gradients etc.
