1. Define LSTMCell layer according to eqs 2, 3 in section 4.3. See https://l.messenger.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscuss.pytorch.org%2Ft%2Fdifferent-between-lstm-and-lstmcell-function%2F5657%2F4&h=AT2E6OSfXcIJprgNdkmMoSixKOUgjNdARgof9zG-_-xgUb1UEnPbJRNjmP_xpC8CmSPV_J_BttwwtplwoFMQCy5C4HQOZO_q7LdtrgGor72k68BAKvk8FwH3QKzKVw

2. Implement maskedsoftmax
    don't mask out provinces you're not in control of? 
    because you want to predict sorta what they're gonna do to inform your decision.
3. Implement attention from each of the 81 provinces (input to decoder is this [81, dlbo + dlpo] matrix)

4. Implement ordering of provinces (snaking)


5. different things to try:
    a. do we train with p = only winning players in each game or all players for each game?
    b. implementing attention soft vs hard?
